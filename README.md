# NECOwatercolumn
This model is modified based on the publishcation of Zakem (https://github.com/emilyzakem/eco-watercolumn), including 2 phytoplanktons with different nutrient preference, and uptake threshold is settled for numerical stability. 2 types of heterotrophy and dissolved nitrogen are switched on in this model. Additionally, light inhibition on nitrifiers kinetics is explicitly parameterized for differentiate the controlling factor of light and substrate on the oxidized rate. This modified model, with ecological robustness, permits the ecosystem self-organized from unsteady state to quasi-steady state.
The NECO_qsc is initialted from the quasi-single-cell of autotrophs and vertically homogeneously biochemical parameters in the water column. The NECO_perturb is initiated from the initial conditions files named _nSS, these files include values that perturb the biochemical parameters in the upper 300 m as averaged homogeneously.
