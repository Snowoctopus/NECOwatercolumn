# NECOwatercolumn
This model is modified based on the publication by Zakem (https://github.com/emilyzakem/eco-watercolumn). Papre link: Zakem, E.J., Al-Haj, A., Church, M.J. et al. Ecological control of nitrite in the upper ocean. Nat Commun 9, 1206 (2018). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-03553-w

It includes two phytoplankton species with different nutrient preferences, and an uptake threshold is set for numerical stability. The model also incorporates two types of heterotrophy and accounts for dissolved nitrogen. Additionally, light inhibition on nitrifier kinetics is explicitly parameterized to differentiate the controlling factors of light and substrate on the oxidation rate. This modified model, with its ecological robustness, allows the ecosystem to self-organize from an unsteady state to a quasi-steady state.

The NECO_qsc is initialized from the quasi-single-cell of autotrophs and vertically homogeneous biochemical parameters, except for NO3-, in the water column. The initial NO3- (no3_fSS) in NECO_qsc is based on a fifth-order sinusoidal fitting of bottle data from the HOT station (1988-2022). The NECO_perturb is initialized from the initial condition files named _nSS, which include values that perturb the biochemical parameters homogeneously in the upper 300 meters.
